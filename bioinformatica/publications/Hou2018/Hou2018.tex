%	Preamble

%	Acknowledgement:
%		This is based on a template provided to me by Dott. Francesco Stefanni, from the University of Verona in January 2011.
%
%	Number the slides per section. This makes it easier to track the index of the slides (or number of slides) per section, as opposed to the cumulative number of slides. When I manually track the number of slides for a presentation, each time I refactor the set of slides, I would have to update the slide numbers. I want the computer to do this automatically. Hence, I shall not do this manually.

%	Trying to delay the not-uncommon path of engineering Ph.D.s who end up becoming "PowerPoint engineers"... Hopefully, slapping together a bunch of presentation slides to talk about any topic in any reasonable finite amount of time is not the most useful skill that I would learn as a grad student... Hey, at least I did it in LaTeX/Beamer!!!
