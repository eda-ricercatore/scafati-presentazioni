##	Summary

Content warning: Includes material that is not "SPO-ppropriate".

+ A Latina from a Cuban American family in Hialeah goes to Cornell University for her undergraduate degree to spite her former boyfriend, who hates polysyllabic words.
+ Starts exploring her Latina and Cuban American identities after her former Spanish boyfriend told her about the Spanish conquest of Latin America (or large parts of the Americas).
	- Some of the questions that she asked rhetorically were:
		* What does it really mean to be a minority?
		* How do we construct identity?
		* How is the concept of race forced upon us?
+ She decides to "put off" going to law school, and pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in the Midwest so that she can be a creative writer.
	- She addresses the trade-offs she makes in deciding to go to college and grad school far, far away from home in Hialeah, Florida.
		* E.g., not being able to keep up with events and incidents that happened back home, with her loved ones and friends, with jealousy from her high-school (or K-12) classmates who slog for low wages, while being able to better off herself, her descendents, and pursue her passion.










##	Context in terms of MIT 150th anniversary

+ To improve support for the following student groups at elite research universities (or predominantly white institutions, PWIs):
	- first-generation college students
	- students from low-income families
	- students from underrepresented groups/communities/cultures (on campus)
+ Addressing experiences in addressing racial microaggressions
	- E.g., her classmates and dormmates from Cornell asking her for her opinion about Elián González.
+ Prof. Jennine Capó Crucet gives back to her community in her free time, and her previous job, to mentor first-generation college students, Latinx stuients, and students from low-income families.
