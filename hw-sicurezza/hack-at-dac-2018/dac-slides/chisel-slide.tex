%	Number the slides per section. This makes it easier to track the index of the slides (or number of slides) per section, as opposed to the cumulative number of slides. When I manually track the number of slides for a presentation, each time I refactor the set of slides, I would have to update the slide numbers. I want the computer to do this automatically. Hence, I shall not do this manually.

{
	\frametitle{Hardware Trojan Detection via Chisel HDL}

	Compare different implementations of a component for the {\it PULPino} system
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Use techniques from fault tolerance for detecting hardware trojans. 
	\item While we cannot use TLM/RTL models from others, we can create our own TLM/RTL models (using {\it SystemC}, {\it Verilog}, and/or {\it Chisel HDL}) for components of the {\it PULPino} system.
%	\item E.g., processor, ALU, or adder for the RISC-V ISA.
%	\item The same input is given to these different implementations.
	\item The output of these different implementations is given to a majority gate (i.e., use majority voting).
	\item Components that yield a different output from the majority of the components have hardware trojans.
	\end{itemize}
	Use the aforementioned software redundancy technique to determine which hardware component went bad, and when and how (i.e.., sequence of input patterns) did it go bad.

%	Trying to delay the not-uncommon path of engineering Ph.D.s who end up becoming "PowerPoint engineers"... Hopefully, slapping together a bunch of presentation slides to talk about any topic in any reasonable finite amount of time is not the most useful skill that I would learn as a grad student... Hey, at least I did it in LaTeX/Beamer!!!
