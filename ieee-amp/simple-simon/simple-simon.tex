%	Number the slides per section. This makes it easier to track the index of the slides (or number of slides) per section, as opposed to the cumulative number of slides. When I manually track the number of slides for a presentation, each time I refactor the set of slides, I would have to update the slide numbers. I want the computer to do this automatically. Hence, I shall not do this manually.

	\frametitle{Additional Comments}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Almost all previous work use model checking to verify quantum communication protocols
	\item Use quantum process algebra to verify quantum communication systems, including quantum error correction codes
	\item Use simulation tools for quantum systems to verify their behavior/functionality, especially their correctness and safety properties
	\item Quantum partially observable Markov decision processes (QOMDPs), which are introduced by (Barry, Barry, and Aaronson, 2014), only care about the reachability of a single state (i.e., goal state).: %\vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
		\item The paper does not specifically address the reachability of invariant subspaces.
		\item Goal-state reachability is undecidable for QOMDPs.

%	Trying to delay the not-uncommon path of engineering Ph.D.s who end up becoming "PowerPoint engineers"... Hopefully, slapping together a bunch of presentation slides to talk about any topic in any reasonable finite amount of time is not the most useful skill that I would learn as a grad student... Hey, at least I did it in LaTeX/Beamer!!!
